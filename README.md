# VINV-Coder's Obsidian Templates

This Github repo contains the templates I currently use in my personal Obsidian vault.

## Contents

This repo contains the following templates:
- Daily Note Template
- Weekly Note Template
- QMonthly Note Template
- Quarterly Note Template
- Yearly Note Template
- Zettel Template
- Source Template
- Project Template
- Area Template
- Resource Template

## Date Formats

I use the following date formats in my Obsidian vault:
- **Daily**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Weekly**: YYYY-[W]WW
- **Monthly**: YYYY-MM
- **Quarterly**: YYYY-[Q]Q
- **Yearly**: YYYY

If you wish to use a different date format, you'll need to go through each of the different periodic note templates and change the format to the desired one.

## Usage
To make full use of these templates, you should install and enable the following plugins:
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs)
- [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)

Add the templates you wish into a folder in your Obsidian vault. Next, navigate to the settings for the Templater plugin and ensure that the folder containing the templates is designated as the tmplates folder for Templater to use. I use the following folders to store these notes:

- 1 - Projects
- 2 - Areas
- 3 - Resources
- Sources
- Zetels

Projects represent larger pieces of work or content with a fixed end point and due date. Areas represent facets of my life that I regularly review my performance in and endeavour to imporve in. Resources represent areas of ongoing interest, but don't require me to maintain a standard in.

The notes in the Areas and Resources folder aggregate ntoes which relate to the specific area or topic of interest. They are often larger, wiki-like notes that point in different directions.

In contrast, my zettels are very small and granular. They often stem from sources, other zettels or my own thoughts and musings. These notes are designed to represent individual strands that form a larger line of thinking. I am very intentional and sparing in how I link zettels outwards to other notes to ensure that all links are strong and high-quality.

### Periodic Notes
All my periodic notes reside in a folder titled "Periodic Notes". Each note goes into a folder for its corresponding year. For example, "2023-11-15.md" belongs in "Periodic Notes/2024". My templates have a Templater code line that ensures they are placed in the corresponding year's folder in the Periodic Notes folder. If you want to change this functionality, change the line containing "tp.file.move".


## Folder Hierarchy
### General Note Folders
At the moment, I currently use both the PARA method and original zettelkasten method, made famous by Nicholas Luhman.
